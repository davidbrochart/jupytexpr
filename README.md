# Jupytexpr

I have no idea what this project is, but it is inspired by
[NumExpr](https://github.com/pydata/numexpr), [Dask](https://github.com/dask/dask) and
[IPyParallel](https://github.com/ipython/ipyparallel) (and much smaller).

## Installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/davidbrochart/jupytexpr
```
